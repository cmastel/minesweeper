# Minesweeper
The purpose in Minesweeper is to find and mark all of the mines hidden. This is done by clicking on squares to reveal them. Each square will have one of the following:
- A mine, and if you click on it you'll lose the game
- A number, which tells you how many of its adjacent squares have mines in them
- Nothing. In this case you will know that none of the adjacent squares have mines.
